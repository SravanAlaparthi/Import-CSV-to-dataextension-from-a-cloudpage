# Import-CSV-to-dataextension-from-a-cloudpage

This code is to upload a csv from a cloud page and insert the data into data extension.

1st cloud page (Read CSV file) will read the csv file uploaded and pos the data as JSON to second page

Second cloud page (Insert data into DE) will read the posted JSON and insert it into a data extension. you will need to change attributes in the code of this page as per your file headers. The sample file I used is attached.
